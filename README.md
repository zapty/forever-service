forever-service
===============

Make provisioning node script as a service simple. 

We love nodejs for server development. But, It is surprising to find that there is no standard tool to provision script as a service. Forever kind of tools comes close but they only demonize the process and not provision as service; which can be automatically started on reboots. To make matter worse, each OS and Linux distro has its own unique way of provisioning the services correctly.

Goals
-----
1. Make an universal service installer across various Linux distros and other OS.
2. Automatically configure other useful things such as Logrotation scripts, port monitoring scripts etc.
3. Graceful shutdown of services as default behaviour.

-------------------
* Amazon Linux
* Redhat Linux

Delete service
--------------
```
$ forever-service delete --help

forever-service version 0.x.x


  Usage: delete [options] [service]

  Options:

    -h, --help  output usage information
```
Examples
--------
* Provision a service 'test' with app.js script in current directory

```
$ sudo forever-service install test
```
On Amazon Linux, This command will setup initd script and provision service using chkconfig,
Create logrotate scripts



* Provision a service 'test' with main.js script in current directory

```
$ sudo forever-service install test --script main.js
```



* Custom options for forever 

```
$ sudo forever-service install test -f " --watchDirectory /your/watch/directory -w"
```




* Command line parameters for the script

```
$ sudo forever-service install test --script main.js -o " param1 param2"
```



* Delete service

```
$ sudo forever-service delete test
```
This command will stop service if running, clean up all provisioned files and service




* Get list of running services (Remember all forever command line options are available since we use forever internally)
```
$ sudo forever list
```

Run non nodejs scripts as service
---------------------------------

forever allows to use -c command line parameter to point to alternate command line for execution, using that one can easily launch non-node apps also as service


* Run Java Program as service

```
$ sudo forever-service install javaservice1 -s start.jar -f " -c 'java -Xms1024m -Xmx1024m -jar'"
```
This command will run start.jar using java command line 



* Run PHP Program as service
```
$ sudo forever-service install phpservice1 -s info.php -f " -c php"
```
This command will run info.php using php command line 



Known Issue(s)
--------------
"restart service" command works like stop in Ubuntu due to bug in upstart https://bugs.launchpad.net/upstart/+bug/703800 


Roadmap
-------
Support other Linux distros, OSX, Windows etc.
